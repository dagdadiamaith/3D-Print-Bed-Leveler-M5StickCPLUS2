As I am not a top notch programmer anymore, I used Chat-GPT to make the job.
Thank you Dominick for all the initial work :-D

# OmniLevel: 3D Print Bed Leveler
A tool that helps makers and professionals level their FDM-based 3D Print Bed

## Overview ##
Do you ever find it a hassle to manually level your 3D print bed every time you make a print? Even seasoned 3D printing pros need to level the printbed after every couple prints. Weâ€™ve created a device that helps tremendously improve this procedure. This project, codenamed OmniLevel, helps you level your 3D printer bed with just a push of a button. We used the M5Stick-C to monitor the pressure between the nozzle of an extruder and the printer bed. Using a force sensitive resistor (FSR), this allows the user to easily detect when the bed is level.

## Supplies and Materials ##
For this project, you will need the following materials:

- M5StickC - $25 on Amazon
- Male 8-pin header - $1 at Parts store or salvaged
- Round Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR sensor) - $7 on Adafruit
- 10k Ohm Resistor - $0.50 at Parts store or salvaged

Overall, it should cost you less than $40 to build.

It is highly recommended that you have the following supplies:

- Wire Strippers/Cutter
- Soldering iron w/ solder
- Tweezers
- Hot glue or UV glue (to isolate connections)
- A piece of large heat-shrink (to protect the circuit)
